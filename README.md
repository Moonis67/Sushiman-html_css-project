I created 🍣 Sushi Website!
This is a modern, fully responsive sushi website I built by following the JavaScript Mastery tutorial — with my own creative twists and enhancements.

🧠 What I Learned & Applied
I focused on writing clean HTML/CSS, modular JavaScript, and used techniques like:

AOS (Animate On Scroll) for scroll animations

CSS Variables for consistent styling

Flexbox & Positioning for responsive layout

BEM Naming for better structure

Reusable JavaScript functions for rendering content

Media queries & fluid design for mobile responsiveness

💡 Sections Included
Navigation Bar

Hero Section with smooth animations
